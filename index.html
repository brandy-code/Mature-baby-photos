    <h1>How I started photography</h1>
    <p>I am so passionate about photos. They allow us to capture a moment in time and come back later and relive all the emotions present when the photo was taken. Some photos do have sad memories attached to them but they are still worth cherishing. I therefore started taking photos with my mobile phone camera and I loved it!</p>
